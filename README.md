# PyRemoteShellLab
A lightweight multi-session remote access lab framework built in Python to teach ethical hacking, socket communication, and client-server architecture.
# PyRemoteShellLab

**PyRemoteShellLab** is a lightweight, Python-based Command and Control (C2) educational framework that demonstrates how multi-session remote access systems work. It enables students and ethical hackers to understand the core building blocks of remote shell management, socket communication, file transfer, and session control.

## 🧠 What It Does

PyRemoteShellLab consists of two components:

### 1. **Server (C2 Controller)**
- Listens for incoming client connections
- Maintains multiple concurrent sessions using threading
- Offers an interactive shell to interact with any connected client
- Allows upload/download of files to/from clients
- Can background sessions, kill sessions, or re-establish them

### 2. **Client (Agent)**
- Connects back to the server (supports dynamic IP config in custom setups)
- Accepts shell commands and executes them on the host system
- Sends command output back to the server
- Supports file upload/download using base64
- Can take screenshots using `mss`
- Contains optional persistence feature using Windows registry

## 🛠 Lab Setup

You’ll need:
- Python 3.8+
- One Windows VM for running the client
- One Linux or Windows machine for running the server
- `mss`, `pyautogui`, and `requests` modules for full client capabilities

### Install Dependencies (client only):
```bash
pip install mss pyautogui requests
```

> Tip: Test in **VirtualBox or VMware** with Host-only or NAT networking.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Server:
```bash
python server.py
```
You’ll be dropped into the `Manager>` interactive prompt.

### Client:
```bash
python client.py
```
Client attempts to connect to the server IP defined in the script.
